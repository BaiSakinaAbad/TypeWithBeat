# Type with Beat

## Introduction
**Type with Beat** is a web-based typing game that combines typing speed, accuracy, and rhythmic timing for an engaging and challenging experience. Developed as a final project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course, this game introduces a unique twist to traditional typing tests by incorporating a metronome beat. Players type words in sync with a predefined tempo, making it feel like a dance for their fingers! Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Type with Beat offers a fun way to improve typing skills while keeping rhythm.

The game challenges players to:
- Type words correctly and in sync with a steady metronome beat.
- View detailed post-test analytics, including Words Per Minute (WPM), Accuracy, and KeyStroke timing (beat deviation).

Whether you're a beginner typist or a seasoned pro, Type with Beat provides a dynamic and rhythmic way to enhance your skills.

- **Post-Game Analytics**: View detailed results, including:
  - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Measures typing speed.
  - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct keystrokes.
  - **Beat Deviation**: Average time difference between keystrokes and metronome beats, shown in milliseconds.
- **Visual Feedback**: Errors are highlighted in red, and the next character to type is marked, making it easy to follow along.
- **Interactive Charts**: Results are displayed in colorful doughnut charts (powered by Chart.js) for WPM, accuracy, and beat deviation.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop browsers, with a clean and intuitive interface.
